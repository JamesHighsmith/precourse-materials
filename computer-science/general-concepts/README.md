# BASICS

## QUESTIONS

- What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous processing? What is a Promise in JS? How are promises handled in JS? How do other languages (go, python, etc) handle asynchronous function calls?
- What is the difference between parallel and concurrent processing?
- What is an anonymous or lambda function? Why would you ever use this?
- Why would you choose one language over another? Can you give an example scenario and trade off two languages?
