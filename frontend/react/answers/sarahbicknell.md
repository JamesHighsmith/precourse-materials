### What is a hook? Can you explain what the built in hooks are, and when you would use them?
hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle freatures in function components. this allows the code to be simpler and more concise, with logic separated off into functions and more easily reusable. some important built in hooks are useState (lets you add state to function components), useEffect (lets you perform side effects in function components), and useRef (lets you access DOM nodes directly) 
### What is a component? Why are components important?

## ADVANCED
### What are some of the differences between React, Svelte, and Angular? Why are they important?

React is a library with a rich ecosystem and community, Svelte is a compiler that generates optimized standard Javascript, and Angular is a full JS framework for the development of single page applications.
React offers an ecosystem and flexibilty that make it useful to a wide range of projects, Svelte's minimalism makes it is faster to develop and more efficient to run, and Angular is suitable to enterprise applications that are highly structured and boilerplate and require stronger security
