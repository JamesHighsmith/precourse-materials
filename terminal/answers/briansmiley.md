### What is a terminal? A CLI? Why are they synonymous?

A terminal or Command Line Interface is a text based interface for interacting with a computer operating system. They are synonymous because the terms refer to the same thing (more or less;usage can vary slightly)

### What is the difference between bash and zsh?

Bash and ZSH are two different shell programs/languages for interfacing with a Unix operating system. They are very similar but zsh is a somewhat newer shell with features like autocompletion, spelling correction, and plugins.

### What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line?

**Terminal**: Text-based computer system interface

**Console**: Could refer to a physical computer interface or a text-based interface as in the browser's JS console which interacts with a shell-like system 

**Shell**: A computer program which takes commands and allows Terminal/Console users to interact with a computer system

**Command Line**: As above, roughly synonymous with "Terminal". Broadly refers to any system where lines of text are entered as commands and cause a system to execute functions.
