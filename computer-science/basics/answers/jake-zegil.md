### What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions, used for performing calculations or solving problems.

### What is a function?

A function is a "callable unit" - some _thing_ that can be invoked with arguments (input) and usually (but not always) returns an output. A function may perform a view or calculation, or it may perform actions that mutate state.

### What is a variable?

A variable is a named reference. It may refer to to a mutable or immutable value, an object or set of values, or it may even refer to nothing, explicitly (null) or implicitly (undefined).

### What is a data type?

A data type is a classification of a variable or other anonymous (non-referenced) data that defines how that data is interacted with or constrained by a program or language. Interactions and constraints may be permitted operations, maximum or minimum size (total memory allocation), view behaviors, or explicit ranges. 

### What is a web server?

A web server (in software) is a computer program that uses a HTTP(S) request/response model to serve content and perform actions. It controls access to an underlying server, which might interact with application services and databases, call out to other web servers, structure and transform information, etc.
