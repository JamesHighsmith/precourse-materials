## QUESTIONS

### What is time complexity?

Time complexity is the time it takes an algorithm to solve a given problem. We use big-O notation to represent time complexity.

### What is space complexity?

Space complexity is the amount of memory required by a algorithm to solve a problem. Example: When adding two numbers we need one additional memory space so the space complexity here is S(n) = O(1).

### What is a pointer and reference?

A pointer is an alias for a value that already exists. We store the address of another variable in the memory location of the pointer variable. A reference is also an alias for a value but it doesn't have a spot in memory. Instead, it takes up some space in the stack. Both of these effectively have the same purpose but there are some differences. Such as the ability to have a null pointer which is helpful in logical operations and the ability to reassign a pointer. Note that references cannot be reassigned because it has not memory location.

### What is a data structure? What are the types of data structures?

### What is a call stack? Why is it important?
