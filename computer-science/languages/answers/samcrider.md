## QUESTIONS

### What is a programming language?

A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.

### What is a software framework?

A software framework is a structure that acts as a foundation for a programmers project. They select and are build from one or two languages. The set structure of a framework makes working with others easier and lets programmers focus on implementing code specific to their application.

### What is the difference between a programming language vs a framework?

A framework is built using a programming language. The language is the tool used to write code and the framework is the plateform on which the code is written.

### What is the difference between a procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming language?

In object-oriented languages data and functions behave similarly and objects are used commonly while in procedural languages data and functions are treated as separate entities and code follows specific routines. Functional languages focus on creating functions that use pure, immutable data.

### What is the difference between a typed and non-typed language?

In a typed language all variables must have a specific attribute attached to them, denoting what kind of data they hold. In a non-typed language, this is not the case, variables can hold any type of data.

### What is the difference between a compiled and interpreted language? Is JS compiled or interpreted?

A compiled language is code that must be converting into machine code in order to be processed and executed by the computer. Interpreted languages are translated line by line as the program runs by an interpreter. The code is not directly translated by the computer. For example, Javascript is an interpreted language that uses JIT (just in time) compilation to translate code into machine code just before it is executed, while C is a compiled language that must be converted into machine code to be executed by the computer.
