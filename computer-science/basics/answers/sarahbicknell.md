# BASICS
## QUESTIONS
### What is data?
Data is information in the form of symbols that can be moved or processed efficiently
### What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a finite, well defined process of instructions that can be implemented by the computer to solve a certain problem or carry out a computation 
### What is a function?
A function is a block of code that can be called upon to perform a discrete action, usually processing an input and returning an output 
### What is function scope? What is a block scope? What is global scope?
Scope is the accessibility of a variable relative to parts of your code. Variables declared within a function are only accessible within the function. Similarly variables declared within a block are limited in scope to within the block. Variables declared outside of any functions or block have global scope i.e. are accessible anywhere in the code.
### What is a variable?
A variable is a way to store and point to information to manipulate in your program; an identifier that can contain a value or information
### What is a data type?
Data type is an attribute that groups data by the values it can take and what you can do with it
### What is a data structure? What are some examples?
A data structure is a particular way of organizing data that may have different rules to its use. Examples: arrays, lists, graphs, matrices
### What is a web server?
A computer system that hosts sites on the internet, processing network requests and serving webpages to requesters’ browsers
### What is an operator?
An operator is a symbol that signifies a specific mathematical or logical operation
### What is a character? A string?
A character is a single symbol, can be a number, letter, or other symbol. A string is a sequence of characters, a data type used to manipulate text
### What is state? Why is it important?
An application’s state is its stored information at a given time, determines the behavior of an application and how it can be interacted with 
### What is an interface?
An interface is a shared boundary across which information is shared, for example a user interface that allows a person to share information with a computer and v.v.
### What is an API?
API(Application Programming interface) is a software interface that enables two or more programs to interact with each other , or the set of protocols that specifies how to build or use this interface
## ADVANCED
### What are calculations (e.g. “pure functions”)?
A calculation is an operation that computes and returns values based on a given input. A pure function is a calculation that is DETERMINISTIC (will always return the same result given the same inputs) and has NO SIDE EFFECTS (does not alter any external state)
### What are actions (e.g. “side-effectful functions”)?
Actions are operations that go beyond simple calculations and perform tasks that have side effects, meaning they change the external state (e.g. changing the file system), depend on external state (making its outputs non-deterministic) or have an observable interaction with the outside world (such as making a network request)
