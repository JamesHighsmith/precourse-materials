# FRACTAL BOOTCAMP: PRECOURSE MATERIALS

These are the pre-course materials for Fractal Bootcamp (https://fractalbootcamp.com/). This repository is meant to be interactive (please PR) and teach you everything you need to be successful in the bootcamp.

## INSTRUCTIONS

For each folder, go through the relevant modules or submodules and read the questions.

For each module:

1. Check out a new git branch, called `${your_name}/${module_name}`. If you don't know what this is or how to do it via the command line, read the git and terminal basics sections.

2. Create a new file `${your_name}.md`, under the `answers` folder in the module.* (bonus: use the terminal to do this)

3. Copy the answers in the module's `README.md` into your file. (bonus: use the terminal to do this)

4. Read through the resources and do your own research online. Drawing on your understanding, answer the questions in the your answer file.

5. Save and commit your new file. Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch. Add @jakezegil and/or a friend as the PR reviewer. (bonus: use the terminal to do this)

*see `computer-science/basics/answers/jake-zegil.md` for an example submission

## GUIDELINES

Refer to the `SCHEDULE.md` for the recommended sequencing. This is not prescriptive - feel free to jump around or skip modules that you're already familiar with.

There's no rules - reading through other's answers or working with a partner can be really helpful for learning. But please, for your own sake, don't copy and paste things. Framing your understanding in your own words is a powerful and valuable exercise.

ChatGPT is a great resource for having conversations about many of these questions and topics.

## TACTICAL TIPS

Whenever you see a word that you don't fully understand, write it down and define it.

Everything that is in this repository matters for writing software, and many things relate to each other. Always ask yourself, how does this relate to the other concepts that I've learned?

Use the terminal as much possible.
